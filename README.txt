A limited number of tickets for the cricket championship go on sale tomorrow, and ticket orders are to be filled in the order in which they are received. 
Write a program that a box-office cashier can use to enter the names, addresses and cities of the persons ordering tickets together with the number of tickets requested and store this information in a list.

The program should then produce a sequence of mailing labels (name, address, city, number of tickets) for orders that can be filled.

Also count number of tickets booked city-wise. 

Note: The program must check that no one receives more than four tickets and that multiple requests from the same person are disallowed
